This visualization provides an overview of sales trends over time. It includes line charts showing monthly sales and a bar chart displaying sales by category. Users can filter by specific time periods and categories to drill down into the data.

### Profit Analysis


The profit analysis visualization showcases the distribution of profits across different product segments. It includes a treemap chart that highlights the most and least profitable segments, allowing users to quickly identify areas of opportunity or concern.

### Customer Segmentation


This visualization employs a scatter plot to illustrate customer segments based on their order frequency and average order value. The color-coded clusters provide insights into different customer behaviors, enabling marketing strategies targeted at specific segments.

### Geographic Sales Map

The geographic sales map displays sales data on a map, showing the geographic distribution of orders and sales values. Users can interact with the map to zoom in on specific regions and hover over markers to view detailed sales information.
